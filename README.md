# Floods-and-Burnt-Area-Identification
The Fire & Flood detection API developed for the SnapEarth project facilitates user access to Sentinel-2 satellite data, allowing customization based on location and date parameters. Additionally, the API incorporates a classification module that enables users to specify their interest in identifying burnt or flooded areas. Notably, the system employs thresholding classification methods to recognize and delineate areas affected by fires or floods. This approach ensures efficient and accurate categorization, enhancing the API's ability to extract valuable insights from the satellite data for users focused on environmental analysis within the SnapEarth project.
